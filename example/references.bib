	abstract = {We present BAG2, a framework for the development of process-portable Analog and Mixed Signal (AMS) circuit generators. Such generators are parametrized design procedures that produce schematics, layouts, and veriﬁcation testbenches for a circuit given input speciﬁcations. This paper expands on previous work by introducing a universal AMS circuit veriﬁcation framework into BAG2, as well as two new layout engines, XBase and Laygo, that enable development of process-portable layout generators. We have developed various complex circuit generators as driving examples, including a time-interleaved SAR ADC and a SerDes transceiver frontend. Instances of these designs have been produced in a TSMC 16nm FFC process; we however verify our claims of process portability by presenting circuits generated (using a single methodology code-base and only primitives adapted to the speciﬁc process) in various technology nodes, including TSMC 28nm, TSMC 16nm, GLOBALFOUNDRIES 45nm RF-SOI, ST 28nm FD-SOI, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES 22nm FDX.},

	abstract = {We introduce a ﬁrst principles, end-to-end analysis of opto-electronic communication links which incorporates a thorough model of the receiver circuitry, in addition to the more familiar laser transmitter optimization. In particular, we optimize receiver sensitivity and power by studying their dependence on front-end design as well as follow-on digital sampler requirements. We ﬁnd that the photo-receiver sensitivity is the most important factor in controlling the overall link power consumption. Our physical model and circuit optimization principles are applied to a heterogenous-integrated photonic+CMOS platform, where we show state-of-the-art performance through this physics-based rapid-design protocol. Incidentally this greatly simpliﬁes the design process. Lastly, we apply this approach to extrapolate future performance trends, platform bottlenecks, and fundamental limits in optical link design while showcasing the potential for sub-1fJ/bit system efﬁciency at high speeds.},

	abstract = {The design of analog integrated circuits (ICs) is characterized by time-consuming and non-systematic iterations between electrical and physical design steps in order to achieve successful post-layout designs. This paper presents an innovative methodology for automatic optimization-based sizing of analog ICs that takes into consideration complete layout-related data for both circuit’s geometric requirements, which are obtained from the real-time in-loop floorplan packing, and circuits’ electrical performance that is evaluated using circuit simulator and considering accurate layout parasitic estimates. In order to boost the parasitic extraction efficiency, the need for expensive detailed layout generation, as found in previous state-of-the-art layoutaware sizing approaches, is here circumvented. However, the interconnect parasitic capacitances that are major contributors to performance degradation and on-die signal integrity problems, must be accurately accounted for. Therefore, an empirical-based parasitic extraction is performed on an early-stage layout obtained from the floorplan, computing the optimal electromigration-aware wiring topology and shortest rectilinear paths in-loop, without the need for detailed routing. Finally, the methodology is demonstrated for the UMC 130nm design process using well-known analog building blocks proving the generality, accuracy and fast execution of the proposed approach.},
