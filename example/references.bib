	abstract = {We present BAG2, a framework for the development of process-portable Analog and Mixed Signal (AMS) circuit generators. Such generators are parametrized design procedures that produce schematics, layouts, and veriﬁcation testbenches for a circuit given input speciﬁcations. This paper expands on previous work by introducing a universal AMS circuit veriﬁcation framework into BAG2, as well as two new layout engines, XBase and Laygo, that enable development of process-portable layout generators. We have developed various complex circuit generators as driving examples, including a time-interleaved SAR ADC and a SerDes transceiver frontend. Instances of these designs have been produced in a TSMC 16nm FFC process; we however verify our claims of process portability by presenting circuits generated (using a single methodology code-base and only primitives adapted to the speciﬁc process) in various technology nodes, including TSMC 28nm, TSMC 16nm, GLOBALFOUNDRIES 45nm RF-SOI, ST 28nm FD-SOI, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES 22nm FDX.},

In particular, we optimize receiver sensitivity and power by studying their dependence on front-end design as well as follow-on digital sampler requirements. We ﬁnd that the photo-receiver sensitivity is the most important factor in controlling the overall link power consumption. Our physical model and circuit optimization principles are applied to a heterogenous-integrated photonic+CMOS platform, where we show state-of-the-art performance through this physics-based rapid-design protocol. Incidentally this greatly simpliﬁes the design process. Lastly, we apply this approach to extrapolate future performance trends, platform bottlenecks, and fundamental limits in optical link design while showcasing the potential for sub-1fJ/bit system efﬁciency at high speeds.},

	abstract = {The design of analog integrated circuits (ICs) is characterized by time-consuming and non-systematic iterations between electrical and physical design steps in order to achieve successful post-layout designs. This paper presents an innovative methodology for automatic optimization-based sizing of analog ICs that takes into consideration complete layout-related data for both circuit’s geometric requirements, which are obtained from the real-time in-loop floorplan packing, and circuits’ electrical performance that is evaluated using circuit simulator and considering accurate layout parasitic estimates. In order to boost the parasitic extraction efficiency, the need for expensive detailed layout generation, as found in previous state-of-the-art layoutaware sizing approaches, is here circumvented. However, the interconnect parasitic capacitances that are major contributors to performance degradation and on-die signal integrity problems, must be accurately accounted for. Therefore, an empirical-based parasitic extraction is performed on an early-stage layout obtained from the floorplan, computing the optimal electromigration-aware wiring topology and shortest rectilinear paths in-loop, without the need for detailed routing. Finally, the methodology is demonstrated for the UMC 130nm design process using well-known analog building blocks proving the generality, accuracy and fast execution of the proposed approach.},

    Abstract = {Recent advancements in silicon photonics show great promise in meeting the high bandwidth and low energy demands of emerging applications. However, a key gating factor in ensuring this necessity is met is the utilization of a link design method- ology which transcends the various levels in the hierarchy, ranging from the device and platform level up to the systems level. In this dissertation, a comprehensive methodology for link design will be introduced which takes a two-prong approach to tackling the issue of silicon photonic link efficiency. Namely, a fundamentals-based first principles approach to link optimization will be introduced and validated. In addition, physical design trade-offs connecting levels in the architectural hierarchy will also be studied and explored. This culminates in an intermediate goal of this dissertation, which is the first-ever design and verification of a full silicon photonic interconnect on a 3D integrated electronic-photonic platform. To proceed and further enable the rapid exploration of the link design architectural space, the analog macros for a majority of this dissertation were auto-generated using the Berkeley Analog Gen- erator (BAG). With these key design tools and framework, performance bottlenecks and improvements for silicon photonic links will be analyzed and, from this analysis, the motivation for a new, single comparator-based PAM4 receiver architecture shall emerge. This architecture not only showcases the tight bond in dependency between high-level link specifications and low level device parameters, but also shows the im- portance of physical design constraints alongside fundamental theory in influencing end-to-end link performance.}

A pre-amplification stage helps reduce the offset voltage of the sense amplifier by magnifying the input of the regeneration stage. The self-timed regenerative latch simplifies the timing logic so the DTSA can replace the SA with no area overhead. A test chip in 28nm technology achieves 56\% error rate reduction at 0.44V. The proposed scheme achieves 50mV of VDDmin reduction compared to commercial SRAM with a faster timing option that demonstrates a smaller bitline swing.},
