\begin{acknowledgements}
Thank you to professor Vladimir Stojanovi\'c for the advising and guidance through this project. Starting is often the hardest part, as is finding a direction to follow. Huge thank you to Sidney Buchbinder and Ruocheng Wang for mentoring me through my degree. Thank you for answering my multi-hundreds of questions and teaching me roughly one semester's worth of information in just a few weeks total.  I asked for design experience and I got it; and you helped me through it.

Additional thanks to all of team Vlada, Panos, Christos, Olivia, Pavan, Nandish, Taewhan and Eric for making my research experience bearable. Finally, thank you to Eric Chiang [CHECK SPELLING] for creating BAG so that I never had to do layout by hand.
